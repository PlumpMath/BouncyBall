# BouncyBall
A simple javascript experiment.  Click to make a bouncing ball.  I want to use this project as a comparison against a clojurescript-based implementation of the same thing.  Although this one uses straight js/HTML, whereas the clojurescript one uses some helper libraries, so maybe not the fairest comparison.

# Todo
Re-do this using a javascript helper library to make it more fair to compare against.  Maybe p5js, or sketchjs.
